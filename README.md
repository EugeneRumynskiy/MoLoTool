# MoLoTool: Transcription Factor Motif Location Toolbox 

## About
MoLoTool (http://molotool.autosome.ru/) is an interactive web application to scan DNA sequences for transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) with position weight matrices presented in [HOCOMOCO](http://hocomoco11.autosome.ru/help) model collection. The sequence markup is text-based and can be easily copied and pasted via clipboard to any MS-Word-type text editor while maintaining colored motif occurrences.
