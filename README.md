# MoLoTool: Transcription Factor Motif Location Toolbox 

## About
MoLoTool (https://molotool.autosome.org/) is an interactive web application to scan DNA sequences for transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) with position weight matrices presented in [HOCOMOCO](https://hocomoco11.autosome.org/help) model collection. The sequence markup is text-based and can be easily copied and pasted via clipboard to any MS-Word-type text editor while maintaining colored motif occurrences. 


## HOCOMOCO
HOmo sapiens COmprehensive MOdel COllection [(HOCOMOCO)](https://hocomoco11.autosome.org/help) contains Transcription Factor (TF) binding models for human and mouse TFs represented as classic Position Weight Matrices (PWMs, also known as Position-Specific Scoring Matrices, PSSMs) and precalculated score thresholds (see the [website](https://hocomoco11.autosome.org/help) for details).
